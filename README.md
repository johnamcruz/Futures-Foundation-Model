# 🏛️ Futures Foundation Model (FFM)

![Python Unit Tests](https://github.com/johnamcruz/Futures-Foundation-Model/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)

**A pretrained transformer backbone for futures market structure and regime classification.**

---

## Overview

Futures Foundation Model (FFM) is an open-source pretrained transformer designed to learn **market structure** and **regime dynamics** from raw OHLCV futures data. The backbone learns general representations of market behavior that can be fine-tuned for any downstream trading strategy.

### Philosophy

> Separate **"understanding market context"** from **"making strategy-specific decisions."**

Just as BERT learns language structure before being fine-tuned for sentiment or Q&A, FFM learns market structure before being fine-tuned for ORB entries, ICT setups, mean reversion signals, or any other strategy.

Input: OHLCV Bars (sequence of N bars × 58 derived features)
         │
    [Instrument Embedding + Session Embedding + Temporal Encoding]
         │
    [Transformer Encoder × 6 layers]
      • Multi-head self-attention (8 heads)
      • Feed-forward network (512-dim)
      • Pre-norm LayerNorm + residual connections
      • Dropout regularization
         │
    [CLS Token Pooling]
         │
    BACKBONE OUTPUT: Market Context Embedding (256-dim)
         │
    ┌────┴────────┴──────────┴────────┴───┐

    │
    └──→ Fine-tune: [Classification] [Regression] [Strategy+Risk]
```

### Model Variants

| Model | Purpose | Output |
|-------|---------|--------|
| `FFMForPretraining` | Multi-task self-supervised pretraining | 4 classification heads |
| `FFMForClassification` | Strategy signal prediction (e.g., BUY/SELL/HOLD) | N-class logits |
| `FFMForRegression` | Continuous value prediction (e.g., dynamic SL/TP) | N positive targets |
| `FFMForStrategyWithRisk` | Combined signal + risk management | Logits + SL/TP distances |

### Pretraining Objectives (Forward-Looking, Self-Supervised)

All labels are **forward-looking** — the model must predict what happens in the **next N bars**, not read the current state. Labels are derived automatically from price data with no manual annotation:

| Task | Classes | Horizon | Description |
|------|---------|---------|-------------|
| **Regime** | Trending Up, Trending Down, Rotational, Volatile | 20 bars | Future return direction + volatility expansion |
| **Volatility State** | Low, Normal, Elevated, Extreme | 10 bars | Forward realized vol ranked vs recent history |
| **Market Structure** | Bullish, Bearish, Mixed | 20 bars | Upside vs downside expansion asymmetry |
| **Range Position** | 5 quintiles (0-20%, ..., 80-100%) | 10 bars | Where future close lands in current range |

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/johnamcruz/Futures-Foundation-Model.git
cd Futures-Foundation-Model
pip install -e .
```

### Using the Pretrained Backbone

```python
from futures_foundation import FFMConfig, FFMBackbone

# Load pretrained backbone
config = FFMConfig()
backbone = FFMBackbone(config)
backbone.load_pretrained("path/to/checkpoint")

# Get market context embeddings
embeddings = backbone(features_tensor)  # (batch, 256)
```

### Fine-Tuning for a Strategy

```python
from futures_foundation import FFMForClassification

# ORB strategy: BUY / SELL / HOLD
model = FFMForClassification(config, num_labels=3)
model.load_backbone("path/to/pretrained/backbone")
model.freeze_backbone(freeze_ratio=0.66)  # Freeze bottom 2/3

# Train only the top layers + classification head
optimizer = torch.optim.AdamW(model.trainable_parameters(), lr=1e-4)
```

### Combined Strategy + Risk Management

```python
from futures_foundation import FFMForStrategyWithRisk

# Signal head (BUY/SELL/HOLD) + Risk head (SL/TP in ATR units)
model = FFMForStrategyWithRisk(config, num_labels=3, num_risk_targets=2)
model.load_backbone("path/to/pretrained/backbone")
model.freeze_backbone(freeze_ratio=0.66)

outputs = model(features)
# outputs["signal_logits"]    → (batch, 3)  BUY/SELL/HOLD
# outputs["risk_predictions"] → (batch, 2)  [sl_atr, tp_atr]
```

## Data Preparation

### Supported Instruments

Currently pretrained on 5 instruments (~1.7M bars total):

| Instrument | Symbol | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| **ES** | E-mini S&P 500 | US large cap index |
| **NQ** | E-mini Nasdaq 100 | US tech index |
| **RTY** | E-mini Russell 2000 | US small cap index |
| **YM** | E-mini Dow | US blue chip index |
| **GC** | Gold Futures | Precious metals |

Extensible to: SI (Silver), CL (Crude Oil), NKD (Nikkei), and more.

### Input Format

Place your OHLCV CSV files in your data directory:

```
data/raw/
├── ES_5min.csv
├── NQ_5min.csv
├── RTY_5min.csv
├── YM_5min.csv
└── GC_5min.csv
```

Each CSV should have columns: `datetime, open, high, low, close, volume`

### Feature Derivation (58 Features)

Features are instrument-agnostic via ATR normalization:

| Group | Count | Examples |
|-------|-------|---------|
| Bar Anatomy | 8 | Body/wick ratios, range in ATR |
| Returns & Momentum | 8 | Multi-horizon returns, acceleration |
| Volume Dynamics | 6 | Relative volume, delta proxy |
| Volatility Measures | 6 | ATR z-score, realized vol |
| Session Context | 5 | Distance from session OHLC + VWAP |
| Market Structure | 9 | Swing distances, range position |
| CRT Sweep State | 10 | 1H/4H prior-candle liquidity sweep events |
| Candle Psychology | 6 | Candle type, engulf count, momentum speed, wick rejection, dir consistency, bar size vs session |

#### CRT Sweep State Features

Candle Range Theory (CRT) sweeps occur when a bar wicks beyond the prior candle's high or low and closes back inside it — a liquidity sweep that often precedes directional expansion. These features capture sweep activity on the 1-hour and 4-hour timeframes and align it to each base bar:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `swp_1h_bull_active` | 1H bull sweep active (wicked below prior low, closed above it) |
| `swp_1h_bear_active` | 1H bear sweep active (wicked above prior high, closed below it) |
| `swp_1h_age_norm` | Normalized age of the most recent 1H sweep (0 = fresh, 1 = expired) |
| `swp_1h_magnitude` | ATR-normalized wick penetration depth of the 1H sweep, clipped to [0, 3] |
| `swp_4h_bull_active` | 4H bull sweep active |
| `swp_4h_bear_active` | 4H bear sweep active |
| `swp_4h_age_norm` | Normalized age of the most recent 4H sweep |
| `swp_4h_magnitude` | ATR-normalized wick penetration depth of the 4H sweep, clipped to [0, 3] |
| `swp_tf_alignment` | Timeframe alignment: +1 (both bullish), -1 (both bearish), 0 (mixed) |
| `swp_dominant_dir` | Dominant sweep direction across timeframes (same as `swp_tf_alignment`) |

Sweep state is forward-filled for a frequency-agnostic expiry window (1 hour = `round(60 / bar_minutes)` bars) so the features work correctly on 3-min, 5-min, or any other base timeframe.

#### Candle Psychology Features

Strategy-agnostic price action descriptors computed from raw OHLCV. These capture candle structure, sequential momentum, and session context without embedding any specific setup logic:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `candle_type` | Categorical candle class: 0=doji, 1=bull strong, 2=bear strong, 3=bull pin, 4=bear pin, 5=neutral |
| `engulf_count` | Count of prior N bars (default 5) whose bodies are fully engulfed by the current bar |
| `momentum_speed_ratio` | Ratio of impulse speed to retrace speed over a rolling window; >1 = impulse leg dominant, <1 = retrace dominant |
| `wick_rejection` | Signed wick asymmetry: `(lower_wick − upper_wick) / range`, range [−1, 1]; positive = bullish rejection, negative = bearish rejection |
| `dir_consistency` | Fraction of the last N bars (default 5) whose close-open direction matches the current bar; range [0, 1] |
| `bar_size_vs_session` | Current bar range relative to the running session average range (resets at session open); >1 = larger than session average |

## Training

### Two-Stage Pipeline

**Stage 1: Pretrain** the backbone on all instruments with self-supervised tasks:

```bash
python scripts/pretrain.py \
    --data-dir data/raw/ \
    --output-dir checkpoints/pretrained/ \
    --epochs 50 \
    --batch-size 256 \
    --lr 1e-3 \
    --seq-len 64
```

**Stage 2: Fine-tune** for a specific strategy:

```bash
python scripts/finetune.py \
    --backbone checkpoints/pretrained/best_backbone.pt \
    --strategy orb \
    --data-dir data/orb_labeled/ \
    --output-dir checkpoints/orb/ \
    --freeze-ratio 0.66 \
    --epochs 30 \
    --lr 1e-4
```
