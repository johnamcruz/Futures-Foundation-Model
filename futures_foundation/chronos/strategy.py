"""StrategyLabeler protocol — the single pluggable seam.

A concrete strategy lives OUTSIDE this public package (private colabs/): it
owns its bars, turns causal context into (context, label) training pairs,
and scores predicted decisions into realized per-trade R. The generic
harness and the honest ruler never import a concrete strategy — they only
speak this protocol.

Contract (all implementations MUST honour):
  * causal — every context is bars <= the decision bar; the label is a
    TRAINING TARGET ONLY and may read the realized future.
  * leak-free — in build(), purge any decision whose realized-future label
    window reaches >= test_start (None on the test split = no purge).
  * evaluate() walks the realized future from each decision and returns
    per-trade R INCLUDING cost (cost is the strategy's, not the harness's).
  * contexts are EQUAL-LENGTH 1-D windows (the harness batches them into a
    tensor; ragged lengths break embedding).

Optional: a labeler MAY also expose `features(decision_keys) -> 2-D float
array` (one row per key, aligned to build()'s order). The harness fuses it
with the frozen Chronos embedding (hstack) before the head. Omit it for an
embedding-only model. Keep features causal and reproducible as plain tensor
ops (the deployed single-ONNX export folds them in).
