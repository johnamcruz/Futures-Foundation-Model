"""
    DEPRECATED (2026-07-06) — DERIVED MODEL FEATURE. FFM is a pure SELF-SUPERVISED representation
    model and no longer provides its own hand-crafted model features; the learned embedding replaces
    them (no-handcraft Pivot 2 beat handcraft Pivot 1 live +10%). KEPT for now so the live model
    stays reproducible — slated for removal once Pivot 2 is promoted. Shared TRIGGER PRIMITIVES (ATR,
    pivots, gate, barriers, sessions) are NOT affected and stay. Do NOT build new model features on
    this path; a strategy that needs a specific feature hand-crafts its own.
Window-level feature transforms — companions to the frozen embedding.

These operate on the SAME log-price context window that is fed to the foundation
backbone (e.g. Chronos), and produce a small vector of scalars to CONCATENATE with
the embedding before the downstream head (XGBoost).

Motivation (UniShape lesson): foundation backbones that instance-normalize their
input (Chronos-Bolt) strip absolute level/scale and are direction-poor — their
embedding captures volatility/shape but not the sign/asymmetry of returns. The
differenced series (log-returns) carries that direction information. Empirically a
handful of cheap return-shape scalars beat a second (return) embedding pass through
the same instance-normalizing backbone — so we add the scalars, not another embed.

Pure numpy, instrument-agnostic, no torch / no pandas — safe to import anywhere.
Input convention: W is [n, L] of log-prices (n windows, L bars each, causal:
bars <= decision time). All outputs are float32 and finite (constant windows ->
zeros, never NaN/inf).
