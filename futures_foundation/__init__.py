Futures Foundation Model (FFM)

A futures-market foundation layer built on **pretrained Chronos-Bolt**
(`amazon/chronos-bolt-tiny`, frozen, subprocess-isolated) plus torch-free
feature/label/primitive libraries and a strategy labeling/eval framework.

The from-scratch FFM transformer (model/dataset/pretrain/torch fine-tune
trainer) was retired in favor of Chronos-Bolt (see git tag
`ffm-transformer-final` for the last version with the full torch backbone
stack). Walk-forward training now lives in `futures_foundation.pipeline`
(Bolt embeddings + XGBoost; training now in `futures_foundation.pipeline`
shims). The foundation surface is `futures_foundation.foundation`:

    from futures_foundation.extractors.chronos import backbone as foundation

    foundation.stamp_active_source(context='my run')
    E = foundation.embed_bars(close, indices)      # [N, 256], strictly causal

IMPORT CONTRACT: importing this package must stay **torch-free** — parents
that consume embeddings run XGBoost, and torch+xgboost segfault in one
process on macOS (libomp collision). Every submodule here (including
`finetune`, now labeling/reporting/economics only) imports zero
torch/transformers.

# NOTE: the `chronos` SUBPACKAGE itself is torch/xgboost-free to import
# (its __init__ is docstring-only; head_xgb/finetune/bolt_* lazy-load
# xgboost/torch inside functions), but its pipeline modules are NOT
# re-imported here — users import `futures_foundation.pipeline.<mod>`
# explicitly. This keeps `import futures_foundation` lean and guarantees
# the package stays importable without xgboost installed.
