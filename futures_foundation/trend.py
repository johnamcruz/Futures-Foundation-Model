"""Fast, causal trend-detection primitives — reusable across strategies and the
regime HMM. Low-lag by design: the point is to confirm the trend AT the pivot,
not bars late like ADX (double-smoothed → laggy). Every value at bar i uses only
bars <= i (strictly causal — these are model inputs; one future peek breaks OOS).

  - efficiency_ratio : Kaufman Efficiency Ratio (1 = clean trend, 0 = chop) over a
                       trailing window. Vectorized.
  - kalman_velocity  : constant-velocity Kalman on a series -> (level, velocity);
                       sign(velocity) = direction, |velocity| = trend strength.
                       Adaptive + low-lag (the chop-adaptive gain is why it's
                       responsive). Ported from the validated kalman_nw strategy.
  - ehlers_decycler  : re-exported from pipeline._primitives (THE certified impl
                       the live strategies use — single source of truth).
  - decycler_slope   : signed low-lag trend slope derived from the decycler.

These are the trend confluence the fractal pivot model was missing: a pivot is
the location; these confirm the trend is real before entry.
