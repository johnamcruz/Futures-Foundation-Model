"""Pluggable FORECAST OBJECTIVES — how the multi-horizon candle forecast is supervised.

Add a variant (direction head, quantile, excursion, ...) as ONE class registered below; the forecast
net + trainer never change (no per-variant if-chains — the trainer just calls the resolved objective).
Each objective declares how many EXTRA head outputs it needs beyond the candle decoder (`aux_dim`) and
its `loss`. A universal per-horizon DIRECTIONAL accuracy is shared — computed off the candle prediction
so it's comparable across every variant regardless of aux head.

Torch-free at IMPORT (torch is pulled in lazily inside the one loss that needs it) so the registry —
resolve-by-name + aux_dim — is testable without the torch/xgboost stack (see tests/conftest.py: torch
imported at module top segfaults the shared xgboost suite via the macOS libomp collision).
