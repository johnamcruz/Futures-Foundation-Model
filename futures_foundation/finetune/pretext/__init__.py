"""Pretext-task REGISTRY — pluggable SSL pretraining objectives (stages).

Add a new pretrain experiment by dropping a module here (subclass PretextTask) and registering
its instance in PRETEXTS below; the orchestrator (ssl.py) stays untouched. Keeping each task in
its own file keeps ssl.py a clean orchestrator.

  mask          (stage 1)   — BERT-style masked modeling
  forecast      (stage 2)   — multi-horizon / variable-context candle seq2seq
  forecast_dist (stage 2.5) — DISTRIBUTIONAL forecast refine ON stage-2 (Chronos-style
                              quantile/bin objectives; own modules, stage-2 untouched)
  contrastive   (stage 3)   — TEMPORAL-NEIGHBORHOOD contrastive: regime geometry from
                              multi-scale time proximity + augmentations, sigma-weighted
                              (replaced the outcome-keyed v1-v3, dropped 2026-07-02)
  electra       (stage 4)   — TURN-ELECTRA (replaced-TURN detection): span-mask the regions around
                              DETECTED SWINGS (the event a pivot entry trades), a weak generator
                              fills each masked turn with a plausible alternative development (a
                              SYNTHETIC FAKE TURN), the encoder labels every bar real/replaced —
                              so it must learn how GENUINE turns develop vs plausible imposters
                              (fakeout-vs-real), pure SSL, zero labels, fully generic; warm from
                              the promoted base. (Prior slot occupants in git history: replaced-
                              candle RTD, break-hold.)
