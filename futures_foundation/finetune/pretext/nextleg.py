"""Stage-2.6 pretext: NEXT-LEG forecasting — the seq2seq family, prediction unit = THE TREND LEG.

From a context window ending at a CONFIRMED fractal pivot, predict the market's own next pattern
element in BARS (user spec 2026-07-16 — bar-counts are instrument- and TF-agnostic, the fractal
unit; NO ATR anywhere — ATR is derived/volatile, raw candles only): (1) how many bars the newborn
leg runs, (2) how many bars the counter-leg (the retest) lasts. Pivots = the PURE fractal detector
(k-bar swing high/low comparisons on raw candles, detect_fractal_pivots — no ATR filter), legs =
alternating swings (keep-first). Targets come from that same deterministic structure applied to
future price — pure self-supervision, zero labels, zero strategy, zero derived indicators.
Direction is NOT predicted (legs alternate: known at confirm — degenerate target).

Why this survives where turn-electra/lc512 died: it stays a FORECASTER (generic objective, the
input/prediction aimed at the pattern unit — the banked design law), keeps the candle-seq2seq
ANCHOR (mse_weight, the anti-drift piece proven load-bearing), warm-starts from the promoted
base with early blocks frozen (the reorder recipe). GATE: the trend-lifecycle scorecard — the
new checkpoint must BEAT the banked per-direction probes (0.7689/0.7635 start, 0.7519/0.7603
end) BEFORE any WR pipeline touches it; the probe gate here is the anti-shortcut forecast gate.
