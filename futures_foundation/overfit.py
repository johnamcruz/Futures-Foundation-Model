"""Reusable overfit-detection & generalization primitives — metric-agnostic.

ONE home for the "default → check generalization → tune only if overfit →
auto-fall-back" decision math, so every training path reuses it instead of
reinventing the wheel:

  - strategy SELECTION heads  (chronos.evaluate / tune_head / train_loop) —
    metric = realized meanR
  - foundation CONTEXT heads  (context training) —
    metric = Pearson r (regression) / ROC-AUC (classification)

Every supported metric is "higher = better", so the same comparisons apply;
callers pass metric-appropriate tolerances (a 0.30R meanR gap and a 0.05 AUC
gap are both "this overfit"). These functions are pure (numpy only), so they
are unit-tested directly and behave identically wherever they are used.
