"""RL-strategy customization contract + registry.

Mirrors the developer experience of futures_foundation.finetune.StrategyLabeler
and pipelines.xgboost.XGBStrategyLabeler (subclass one class, declare the
mechanical entry + a few knobs, register it — the pipeline does
context/walk-forward/PPO/shuffle/multi-seed/gate), with RL-correct semantics.

GENERIC ONLY. A strategy supplies the mechanical ENTRY detector via
detect_entries(); the proprietary detector (e.g. CRT sweep+rejection) is
authored in the private ffm-strategies repo as a plug-in. No strategy IP
ever lives here.

What the PPO policy does (decided by the pipeline, not the strategy):
  • if entry_filter: a learned, asymmetric (take-biased) chop-veto on each
    mechanical entry candidate, conditioned on the FFM context-head;
  • the exit/hold policy, conditioned on context-head ⊕ position state.
The strategy only declares WHERE the mechanical entries are and the
realized-R exit knobs; it never reshapes the policy.
