"""Standalone RL trading pipeline (PPO).

Generic + public: this package holds ONLY the model-agnostic RL machinery —
the RLStrategy contract + registry, the PPO env, walk-forward reuse
(pipelines.common), shuffle + multi-seed gates, a generic context-head
precompute utility, and a device helper. It contains NO proprietary
strategy logic.

A concrete strategy (e.g. the proprietary CRT sweep detector) is supplied
as a plug-in that subclasses RLStrategy and registers itself — authored in
the private ffm-strategies repo, exactly as the CISD scripts plug into
futures_foundation.finetune. The framework stays generic; the IP stays
private.
